Peer-to-peer DM Terminal chat

## How to use it
Just start the program, then either (l)isten or (c)onnect, one person has to listen and then the other one has to connect to it.   
The port is always 8080 for now, and the listeners ip address is shown for the listener, so it can easily be seen.  
Then just write and the messages of the other person are shown in your terminal!
